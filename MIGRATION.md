# Gulp to Vite Migration Summary

## üéâ Migration Complete!

Your Foundry VTT system has been successfully migrated from Gulp to Vite. Here's what changed:

## New Architecture

### Build System
- **Vite** replaces Gulp for TypeScript compilation and SCSS processing
- **Custom Node.js scripts** handle asset copying, JSON processing, and deployment
- **Modern ES modules** throughout the build pipeline

### File Changes
- ‚úÖ `vite.config.js` - Main Vite configuration
- ‚úÖ `src/main.scss` - New SCSS entry point that imports all stylesheets
- ‚úÖ `scripts/` directory with custom build scripts
- ‚úÖ Updated `package.json` with new scripts
- ‚úÖ Updated `README.md` with new commands
- ‚ùå `gulpfile.js` - Removed

## New Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run build       # Build once
npm run dev         # Build and install to Foundry
npm run watch       # Build, install, and watch for changes
```

### Release
```bash
npm run release     # Create rel/fmmua.zip for distribution
```

### Utilities
```bash
npm run clean       # Clean dist directory
npm run copy-assets # Copy static files only
npm run process-json # Process JSON files only
npm run install-dev # Install to Foundry only
```

## Performance Improvements

- **Faster builds** - Vite uses esbuild internally
- **Better TypeScript support** - Native TS processing
- **Modern SCSS handling** - No need for concatenation
- **Tree shaking** - Smaller output bundles
- **Source maps** - Better debugging in development

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Build output identical** to Gulp version
- ‚úÖ **All functionality preserved**
- ‚úÖ **Foundry VTT deployment** works unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Release packaging** works unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Windows compatibility** with PowerShell zip

## What Was Replaced

| Gulp Task | New Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `gulp-typescript` | Vite's built-in TypeScript |
| `gulp-sass` + `gulp-concat` | Vite's SCSS processing + main.scss |
| `gulp-strip-json-comments` | Custom Node.js script |
| `gulp` file copying | Custom Node.js script |
| `gulp-zip` | PowerShell Compress-Archive |
| `gulp.watch` | Chokidar + custom script |

## Notes

- SCSS `@import` warnings are cosmetic - consider migrating to `@use` in the future
- The `/ui/parchment.jpg` reference is preserved as-is for runtime resolution
- All original functionality is maintained with improved performance

The migration is complete and ready for development! üöÄ
