In rough priority order, most to least important

* update to support stable releases 0.7.5-0.7.9, then stick with stable probably

* power cards improvements
    - fit in sidebar without VSR
    - popout? https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/dnd5e/-/blob/master/module/item/entity.js#L297

* macro apis
    - advantage/disadvantage from target picker
    - statuses (arbitrary active effects? initial version could just be note+icon, for people to rules-apply themselves)
    - maybe duration?
    - encounter power used state

* improve character sheet
    - should be 1000x810 currently
    - basic fields after name would allow shortening

* compendium packs 
    - i've got the common powers in there, but nothing else
    - core classes and roles? could prewrite macros. lots of effort. maybe licensing issues.
    - monster traits for gm
    - entire sample monsters?

* reconsider update on submit mode setting (latency issue)

* combat update on alternate resources 
    unfortunately this is in Token - _onUpdateBaseActor and _onUpdateTokenActor, which hardcode handling a single resource
    can call canvas.addPendingOperation(`CombatTracker.render`, ui.combat.render, ui.combat); from anywhere though

* use qfa icons for powers - or replace everything with the new icon library

* use message core.initiativeRoll flag somehow (what we really need is for it to put a tag on the dice.. override Roll?)

* glossary improvements
    - localizable
    - world-editable

* structured character creation?
    - make it easier for players to reuse elements
    - initial setup, use compendia
    - feat/role boost levels
    - advances
    - gm review?
