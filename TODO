In rough priority order, most to least important

* macro apis
    - statuses (via active events - needs parameterisation, tint, no rules effect initially)
    - maybe duration?
    - encounter power used state?

* improve character sheet
    - should be 1000x810 currently
    - basic fields after name would allow shortening
    - status view/editor

* compendium packs 
    - i've got the common powers in there, but nothing else
    - core classes and roles? could prewrite macros. lots of effort. maybe licensing issues.
    - monster traits for gm
    - entire sample monsters?

* reconsider update on submit mode setting (latency issue)

* use qfa icons for powers - or replace everything with the new icon library

* use message core.initiativeRoll flag somehow (what we really need is for it to put a tag on the dice.. override Roll?)

* glossary improvements
    - localizable
    - world-editable

* structured character creation?
    - make it easier for players to reuse elements
    - initial setup, use compendia
    - feat/role boost levels
    - advances
    - gm review?
